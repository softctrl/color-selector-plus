The Color Selector Plus window is divided into three areas:

> it provides a hue slider and a mixing area to choose a color. It also has a palette
> of some standard colors.

> The Color Picker tab has a magnifier. The black square in the center is the current pixel
> pointed by the mouse. Press spacebar while the Color Selector Plus window is in focus to grab a
> color. The level of zoom can be adjusted from the zoom slider.

**2. Color Panel**

> The current selected color and it's rgb, hsb and hex values are shown in this tab. The color can
> be either added to the palette or its hex can be copied to the clipboard.
> 'Copy to clipboard' copies the hex value along with the # symbol.

**3. Color Palette**

> There are 27 slots in a palette.
> Any slot can be selected by clicking on it and cleared by right clicking on it.
> A selected slot has a thick black border. A white colored slot is considerd as an empty slot.

> The palette can be saved by clicking on save. The palettes are stored in the form of a data file
> with .palette extension. It's advised to store a palette in the sketch's data folder.

> Click on Load to load a .palette file.

> Click on Clear All to create a new .palette file.
> The last loaded palette is automatically loaded for convenience.
